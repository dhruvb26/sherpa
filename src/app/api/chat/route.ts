                    The vehicles need to:
                    1. Analyze their current positions, speeds and vehicle characteristics
                    2. Assign roles (leader, follower, wingman) based on their capabilities
                    3. Develop a coordinated plan to maximize average velocity and minimize stops
                    4. Consider safety distances and collision avoidance
                    5. Communicate formally and professionally using vehicle IDs (e.g. CAV_01)

                    Example conversation format:
                    ${JSON.stringify(exampleConversation, null, 2)}

                    When discussing the plan:
                    - Reference specific vehicle data (speed, position, etc.)
                    - Show logical decision making process
                    - Allow back-and-forth discussion between vehicles
                    - Focus on practical coordination to optimize traffic flow
                    - Consider factors like safe following distances
                    - Aim to minimize red lights and maintain optimal speeds

                    Return ONLY a JSON object where:
                    - Keys are vehicle IDs (CAV_XX)
                    - Values are the vehicle's messages
                    - Messages should demonstrate strategic thinking about traffic optimization
